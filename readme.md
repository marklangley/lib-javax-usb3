# About

This is a fork of [KeyBridge/lib-javax-usb3](https://github.com/KeyBridge/lib-javax-usb3). You are almost certainly looking for that project, not this one.

This fork adds a few very-specific capabilities that I needed while experimenting with USB communication protocols. It is of experimental quality and not recommended for real-world use.
